### <span id="countUp"><i>loading..</i></span> and running!

This site has gone through a number of changes over the years.  This was a fun college project that I did in my spare time to explore technology.  It is where I learned PHP and mySQL, most commonly referred to as LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP).  It has also been a test bed for a number of other fun personal projects.  

I have gone through a number of CMS platforms: WordPress, SubText, N2CMS, Umbraco and probably some more.

I have ultimately decided on the [jekyll][jekyll-organization] platform hosted on [github pages][github-pages].  **[Git]** is my favorite version control system that I have worked with; it is a very powerful tool that enhances the software development process.  **[Markdown]** is a great formatting tool for blog posts and for documentation in projects.  The merging of these two technologies feels like a big win.

### About Me

I am a father, husband, exercise enthusiast, gamer, software developer with over 10 years of experience, and a problem solver. I have a lifetime experience of miscellaneous things.  

I work primarily on the stack: C#, SQL Server, Web API, Angular, HTML, and JavaScript.

I love working on automation (CI) with Team Foundation Server and Jenkins (previously).  I have been exploring Github Actions and they look sweet!

I like to use different parts of my brain, so from time-to-time I will write about my personal experiences; sometimes technical; sometimes not.
