Hi I'm Brent Berger.  I am a father, husband, exercise enthusiast, gamer, software developer with over 10 years of experience and a problem solver. I have a lifetime experience of miscellaneous things.  

I like to use different parts of my brain, so from time-to-time I will write about my personal experiences; sometimes technical; sometimes not.
