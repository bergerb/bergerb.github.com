<p>I'm a software developer.  I mainly work on the Windows platforms using c#, vb, jQuery, and SQL.  I love languages: c#, vb, php, python, ruby, java, SQL, javascript.  I think jQuery is swell and github is great.</p>

<p>Some of my other interests include: gaming (minecraft), fishing, hiking, guitar, wine making (and meads).  I'm generally an all around nice guy!</p>
