<p class="meta">10 May 2013</p>

<div id="post">
<p>I ran a fairly active <code>WordPress</code> blog between 2007 and 2009 using the <code>WordPress</code> platform. Towards the end of this time, as life usually catches up to you, and the added maintenance of a host-your-own solution, I didn&#8217;t quite have the time to manage it.</p>

<p>I have been trying to get back into it and have an active blog. I changed web hosts and got WordPress up-to-date and imported all my outdated content. I think WordPress is a great platform for various things (like multimedia, blogging, content) but for just plain-old-blogging <code>(POB)</code> I feel it is a bit of overkill.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried a number of blogging platform to find one that just works for me. I just want to write and publish. Enter Jekyll it&#8217;s simple, extendable, and can even hook into <a href='http://pages.github.com'>github pages</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan and supported of GitHub for nearly two years now. The growth from GitHub is just amazing and I believe it is truly an influential product. Their support of Jekyll in <a href='http://pages.github.com'>github pages</a> really swayed me into taking a look at the software and see what it&#8217;s all about.</p>

<p>I typically run on a <code>Windows</code> machine and I couldn&#8217;t really get it all working on there so I just fired up an <code>Ubuntu</code> image. Getting <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>jekyll</a> running in a linux environment was no problem at all.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.</p>
