I ran a fairly active `WordPress` blog between 2007 and 2009 using the `WordPress` platform.  Towards the end of this time, as life 
usually catches up to you, and the added maintenance of a host-your-own solution, I didn't quite have the time to manage it.

I have been trying to get back into it and have an active blog.  I changed web hosts and got WordPress up-to-date and imported 
all my outdated content.  I think WordPress is a great platform for various things (like multimedia, blogging, content) but for 
just plain-old-blogging `(POB)` I feel it is a bit of overkill.  

I've tried a number of blogging platform to find one that just works for me.  I just want to write and publish.  Enter Jekyll it's simple, 
extendable, and can even hook into [github pages]

I've been a fan and supported of GitHub for nearly two years now.  The growth from GitHub is just amazing and I believe it is 
truly an influential product.  Their support of Jekyll in [github pages] really swayed me into taking a look at the software and 
see what it's all about.

I typically run on a `Windows` machine and I couldn't really get it all working on there so I just fired up an `Ubuntu` image.  
Getting [jekyll] running in a linux environment was no problem at all.  

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
