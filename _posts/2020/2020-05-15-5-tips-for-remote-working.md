I do believe that remote working and working at home during a pandemic are two far different things.  There is overlap and a lot of information can be gleamed from both.  See [Quarantine work is not Remote work](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/QuarantineWorkIsNotRemoteWork.aspx){:target="_blank"}.

## Mindset

- Treat each work day like a work day
- Shower, get dressed, and start your day with a meal
- Wake up at the same time everyday during the week to have a routine
- Exercise 
  - Walk the dog every morning (if you don't have a dog go for a walk)
  - Get a workout in
  - Go for a run

## Track Your Work

I keep a repository of markdown files, by date, that has a history log of what I have been working on.  This has come in handy many times.  Also, I like to keep a history of big milestones or a "brag" list; this is a helpful document when someone asks, "so what have you been doing".  This is a quick refresher of all the problems solved and projects completed.

## Have A Dedicated Work Area

- An area where you work each day is like going to an office
- Having a door is a great plus
- A nice, clean work area is paramount; just like in an office!
- Get an upgraded chair to sit in since you will be spending large periods of time in it

- I recently refurbished a GoodWill L shaped desk.  I removed the particleboard and refinished some nice pine for the top.  Re-use!

## Invest In Technology

- Grab an upgraded microphone, webcam, and headset 
  - I'm currently running:
    - Blue Yeti Nano on a boom arm
    - Microsoft Lifecam HD 3000
    - Logitech G430 headset

- Bonus: Get some additional lighting for visibility i.e. Ring Light on a boom arm

## Disconnect

At the end of the day shut down -- close your editor, e-mail client, and disconnect your VPN.  I like to take the dog for a walk at the end of the work day and get fresh air.  This is a nice break to close out the work day.
