<p>Testing is a hard part of software development.  One of the hardest aspects of development is testing code/features that you have created.  It is easy to put the blinders up and write to the spec.  Insider knowledge of the system probably plays a role in this difficulty.  Seeing a system through user eyes is nearly impossible, but to get close you need to decouple yourself from the code.</p>

<p>Discipling yourself to test your own code and finding your own bugs is a difficult task.  It is possible.  Being a part of a code review process in which the code reviewer(s) look at code and possible bugs has made me a better developer.  You will never find all of the bugs in an application; it takes a team, users, and time.  The more bugs you find earlier the more reliable and usable the code will be.</p>
<p>Testing while you go helps too.  Think of a fringe case?  Go ahead write it down.  Write a test for it.  Do something.</p>
<p>The ability to look at your own code objectively is something I am continually trying to improve at.  Catch bugs sooner.  Make your code better sooner.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>You are not your code</em>

<p>Refine.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>You are not your code</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Why would the user do x / y ?</em></p>
<p>They will.  Many many many times.</p>
<p>Sometimes I click randomly on everything multiple times just to see what will happen.  Curiosity.  Users have curiosity with new features and will push them to their limits.  An in-depth <abbr title="User Acceptance Testing">UAT</abbr> will definitely find a number of bugs / issues.  <abbr title="User Acceptance Testing">UAT</abbr> is important because <em>users</em> will more easily <em>accept</em> <em>tested</em> code versus bug filled applications.</p>
<p>Here is the typical development process that I have had success with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development / Self-Test</li>
<li>Self-Test</li>
<li><abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr></li>
<li>Code Review</li>
<li>If Large Changes? <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> Again</li>
<li><abbr title="User Acceptance Testing">UAT</abbr></li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ul>
