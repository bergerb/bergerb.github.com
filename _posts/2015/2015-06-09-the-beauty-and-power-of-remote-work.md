I am not a 100% remote worker but all my remote software development consulting is 100% - remote.  Communication is the key to having a good relationship with a client and having great results. If you can only send a message saying that you _will_ look at something it is better than silence.  Communicating with yourself about realistic deadlines will help yourself mange your schedule helping to prevent burn-out.  Remote software development is a combination of the beauty and power of its discipline.

The beauty of remote work is the comfort of remote work: to be able to relax at home (or out-and-about) and get a few hours of work in is a great feeling.  I also like to visit various coffee shops, public libraries, or other places of free WiFi.  Being stuck in an office all the time can become a drag and hurt productivity. It has been in my experience that the developers typically draw the short straw for a nice office space or cube.  Keeping a fresh and interesting environment will help keep a developer happy!

The power of remote work is simple; work when you want to. I can honestly say that a lot of my best ideas usually happen somewhere unexpected.  I feel software development is a form of art and those ideas sometimes hit you when you are driving, taking a shower, sleeping, and not something that is entirely _enforceable_.  There are times when you have to make quick decisions, but when you can take the time to think and analyze the situation - it will be a far better solution.  There are deadlines to be maintained - there is a balance between those two forces.  It is powerful and stressful to maintain your own work schedule and deadlines, but it is also liberating.

**Where are we now?**  
**Where are we going?**

I believe in the next 50 years or so the prominence of remote work will only grow. We will look back on this time and have a hard time grasping the concept... so... _we drove everywhere and wasted time on commuting_ when you had the ability to work from home???

It is early in the remote work game... we've come a long way and we have a long way to go. It's adoption has often been met with fear and reluctance unfortunately.
