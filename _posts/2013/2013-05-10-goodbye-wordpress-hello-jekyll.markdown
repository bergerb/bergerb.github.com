I ran a fairly active blog between 2007 and 2009 using the `WordPress` platform.  `WordPress` worked well for my needs and was 
definitely leading mindshare when it came to blogging.  Alternatives have come and gone but `WordPress` has held fairly steady.

I have been trying to get back into blogging and write more regularly.  I changed web hosts and got `WordPress` up-to-date and imported 
all my outdated content.  It seemed like most of the time I was patching `WordPress` and managing comments.  I think `WordPress` 
is a great platform for various things (like multimedia, blogging, content) but for just plain-old-blogging `(POB)` I feel it is a bit of overkill.  

I've tried a number of blogging platform to find one that just works for me.  I just want to write and publish.  Enter [jekyll] it's simple, 
extendable, and can even hook into [github pages].

I've been a fan and supported of [github] for nearly two years now.  The growth from [github] is just amazing and I believe it is 
truly an influential product.  Their support of [jekyll] in [github pages] really swayed me into taking a look at the software and 
see what it's all about.

I typically run on a `Windows` machine and I couldn't really get it all working on there so I just fired up an `Ubuntu` image. 
Getting [jekyll] running in a linux environment was no problem at all.  

Now when I want to write a blog I can type the blog in `markdown`, commit the changes to [github], run the script to upload to my 
web server.  Now I will have all my changes, a mirror, and a way to send out to my production server.

I'm hoping this will allow me to be more productive with my writing meaningful posts and ideas.  

Look for some changes coming soon!
