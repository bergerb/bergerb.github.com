<p>There are a number of patterns that reveal themselves to us daily. The sun rising and setting; the moon exposing itself to the tides below. There is a variance of change depending on the time of the year, month or day. Over time you if you keep track of it; the pattern will emerge. The same truth is applied to software development; over time if you keep track of the changes (success or failure) the pattern will emerge.<!--more--></p>
<p>I love anti-patterns; I love to learn about them in the software world. The world that I am interacting with; I also love to find the patterns that are around us. What commonality does this issue have to similar issues we have had? Some of my favorite anti-patterns are: the golden hammer, NIH (not invented here), and spaghetti code. Not to say that I enjoy these anti-patterns, but that the causation of why these occur. If you keep track of them, i.e. documentation, you will be better equipped to deal with them.</p>
<h3>What is an anti-pattern? See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern</a></h3>
<p>The wrong way to do something in a nutshell.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Hammer</a>:</em> When all you have is a hammer everything looks like nail.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not Invented Here Syndrome</a>:</em> Fear of the unknown - something not invented here can't be trusted.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spaghetti Code</a>:</em> Not maintainable -- jumbled mess of code.</p>
<p>I think this is a good practice of software development: I am not my code. Do not take your code personal.</p>
<h3><strong>What is a pattern?</strong></h3>
<p>Keep track of successes to know what patterns help you succeed.  Documentation of tasks, accomplishments, and other thoughts is a great way to find those patterns.  There are a number of great proven patterns in software and life!</p>
