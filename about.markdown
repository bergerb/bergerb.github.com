Hi I'm Brent Berger.  I am father, husband, running enthusiast, minecrafter, code ninja aka software developer with over 10 years of experience, and a lifetime experience of miscellaneous things.  I like to use different parts of my brain, so from time-to-time I will write about my personal experiences; sometimes technical sometimes not.
